    <h2>About</h2>
  <p>
  Corsair Code Solutions was founded in 2025 with a clear mission â€” to channel a lifelong passion
  for software development into real-world solutions. After graduating from university, Ross Lamont
  spent a brief stint in the IT industry and quickly realized he enjoyed crafting new systems far more
  than troubleshooting existing ones. Corsair Code Solutions represents his commitment to building
  reliable, scalable, and creatively designed software tools, alongside a full suite of tech services
  for individuals and businesses alike.
