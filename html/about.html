    <h2>About</h2>
  <p>
  Corsair Code Solutions was founded in 2025 with a clear mission â€” to channel a lifelong passion
  for software development into real-world solutions. The company got its start in the IT industry
  right after university, but quickly discovered that crafting new systems was far more rewarding
  than troubleshooting existing ones. Today, Corsair Code Solutions remains committed to building
  reliable, scalable, and creatively designed software tools, alongside a full suite of tech
  services for individuals and businesses alike.
